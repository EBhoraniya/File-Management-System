# File-Management-System

Files are managed by operating system.The operating system uses set of methods and data structures to keep track of files on a disk or partition. Thus the part of operating system dealing with files is called the file system. It is the way files are created, organized and stored on the disk. Major functions of file system includes tracking allocated and free space on disk, maintaining directories and file names and tracking where each file is physically stored on the disk.

The project includes basic features of the file system like

1. Create file with specific permissions (Readonly, Read/Write, Execute)
2. Delete file
3. Write file
      a. Append
      b. Overwrite
4. Read file
5. Change File permission
6. Rename
7. Seeking free block in constant time

We will be devoting 20 MB of memory for implementing all these features. We will be using queue, treemap and priority queue to enhance the efficiency of all the features. We used java as the programming language to implement this file system.
